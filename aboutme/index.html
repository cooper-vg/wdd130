    <p>Hi everyone! A little information about me, I am from Maine but currently in Rexburg going to school. I am in accounting but am very interested in getting a basic knowledge in programming and databases. I am into music, sports, as well as being a little bit of a movie-buff.</p>
    <p>I have been a memeber of the church my whole life. I was able to serve a 2 year mission in Ogden, Utah. My favorite go to scripture is without a doubt Mosiah 2:17.</p>
    <p>I am looking forward to learning in this class!</p>
