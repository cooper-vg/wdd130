      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Cooper Van Gieson — an Accounting major with a passion for numbers, systems, and solving problems through structure and logic. I’m currently focused on areas like managerial economics and tax accounting, and I’m drawn to how accounting not only helps businesses stay compliant, but also empowers smarter financial decisions.</p>

      <p>Alongside my academic studies, I’ve been exploring the technical side of accounting and finance. I have a beginner’s grasp of MySQL and Python, and I enjoy using these tools to better understand and organize data. I’m especially confident in Excel and VBA, where I’ve spent time automating reports, building tools, and creating clean, efficient workflows. I find satisfaction in taking complex tasks and simplifying them through thoughtful automation.</p>

      <p>What drives me most is the opportunity to continuously grow. Whether it’s through expanding my technical skill set, learning about new areas of the accounting profession, or working toward personal goals, I strive to push myself forward every day. I value accuracy, consistency, and a solutions-focused mindset — qualities I aim to carry into any role or project I take on.</p>

      <p>Thanks for visiting my site! Feel free to explore more and reach out if you'd like to connect, collaborate, or just talk accounting and analytics.</p>
